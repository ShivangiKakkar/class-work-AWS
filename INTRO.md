Hello Professor! I am Shivangi Kakkar. I completed my undergrad from India, majoring in Computer Science. I started with Web Development in my junior year by taking an udemy course on React. I coded some standard projects like creating a simple [burger builder app](https://my-burger-e14c1.firebaseapp.com/) and a clone of [Amazon.com](https://clone-461ef.web.app/) by following a youtube tutorial.

During my senior year, I was an Open Source Contributor at Mozilla where I worked on the frontend of the add-ons project which is the face of the extensions marketplace for Firefox. This project was primarily in ReactJS. This enabled me to land an internship at Mozilla as a Privacy and Security Engineering Intern, where I worked on triage, prioritization and fixing bugs and building enhancements for the Firefox **Containers add-ons.**

The Advanced Web Server Programming course would help me improve on my back-end coding skills and bring me closer to my objective of becoming a well rounded, successful Full Stack Developer.
